#Shopping Cart

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/shopping-cart) React JS curriculum. 

Overall goal of this project was to build a a shopping cart site with at least two routes. Prior to this project I've learned about React Router library. This library is a very convenient way to build single page web apps with multiple routes.
